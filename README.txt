3. Click run and let the code run

4. Then follow the on-screen prompts:
  • Enter `1` for portfolio metrics & charts  
  • Enter `2` for asset correlation heatmap  
  • It is possible to enter `1,2` to run both analyses in sequence
  • The Returns-Based snippets take a long time to run in an average laptop took around 1hour 
	It is recommended not to run these in sequence
  • If the code fails because of memory consumptions close your IDE and re-run the snippet 

There are two scripts that were run locally concept reasons. They should show up with the results. Due to time constraints they were not integrated in new_main
